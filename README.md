# Apemaster-Player

ApeMaster Player is a playback program that directly plays RTSP video streams on web pages without the need for server transcoding

The ApeMaster Player is developed based on the cross-browser native applet system, using the ApeMaster middleware network advanced edition. It leverages underlying support from Hikvision and Dahua device network SDKs (download links: Hikvision SDK](https://openhikvision.com/download/5cda567cf47ae80dd41a54b3?type=10), Dahua SDK](https://support.dahuatech.com/tools/sdkExploit)) and the open-source LibVLC support library (VLC media player installation required or a portable VLC desktop application).
